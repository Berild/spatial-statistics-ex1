Continuous spatial variable in $\mathbb{R}^1$: 
\begin{align*}
    \{r(x): x \in \text{D} &: [1,50] \subset \mathbb{R}^1\} \\
    E\{r(x)\} &= \mu_r = 0\\
    Var\{r(x)\} & = \sigma_r^2 \\
    Corr\{r(x)\} & = \rho_r(\tau)
\end{align*}

$\tau = |x-x^\prime|/10.$ 
Discretization: $\text{L} \in \{1,2,...,50\}$.
The discretized random field (RF) is 
\begin{equation*}
    \{r(x): x \in \text{L}\}.
\end{equation*}

\paragraph{a)}
A function $c(\vect{\tau}) : \R^q \rightarrow \R$ is positive definite (non-negative definite, to be precise) for $\vect{\tau} \in \R^q$ if
%
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
    & \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_i \alpha_j c(\vect{x_i} - \vect{x_j}) \geq 0 \\
    & \forall [\vect{x}_1, \vect{x}_2, \dots, \vect{x}_n] \in \R^{q \times n} \\
    & \forall \vect{\alpha} \in \R^n \\
    & \forall n \in \mathbb{N}_+ \setminus \{1\} \, .
\end{split}
\end{equation*}
%
In one dimension we replace the vectors $\vect{\tau}, \vect{x}_i$ and $\vect{x}_j$ with scalars $\tau, x_i$ and $x_j$.

Now say that $\sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_i \alpha_j c(\vect{x_i} - \vect{x_j}) < 0$ for some $[x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n]$, $\vect{\alpha}$ and $n$. Then
%
\begin{align*}
    \Var(\sum_{i=1}^n \alpha_i r(x_i)) 
    &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_i \alpha_j \Cov(r(x_i), r(x_j)) \\
    &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_i \alpha_j \sigma^2_r \Corr(r(x_i), r(x_j)) \\
     &= \sum_{i=1}^n \sum_{j=1}^n \alpha_i \alpha_j \sigma^2_r \Corr(r(x_i), r(x_j)) \\
    < 0
\end{align*}

The spatial correlation function $\rho_r(\tau)$ needs to be positive definite because...?

Two possible correlation functions, $\rho_r(\tau)$, the Powered exponential and the Matern. Cruical features for the spatial correlation function...?

Relation variance/correlation with variogram function?

\paragraph{b)}
The discretized prior Gaussian model has pdf
\begin{equation}
    \vect{r} \sim p(\vect{r}) = \phi_n(\vect{r}; \mu_r \vect(i)_n, \sigma_r^2\matr{\Sigma}_r^{\rho}),
\end{equation}
where $n = 50$ is the number of grid points in $\text{L},$ $\vect{i}_n$ is a $n$-vector with $1$s and $\matr{\Sigma}_r^{\rho}$ is the correlation matrix for the grid points, defined from the spatial correlation function.
