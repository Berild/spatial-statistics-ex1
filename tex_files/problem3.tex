We consider the stationary Gaussian RF $\{r(\vect{x}) \ssep \vect{x} \in \mathrm{D} \subset \R^2\}$ with $\mathrm{D} \colon [(1,30), (1,30)]$,
%
\begin{align*}
    \E\{r(\vect{x})\} &= \mu_r = 0 \\
    \Var\{r(\vect{x})\} &= \mu_r^2 \\
    \Corr\{r(\vect{x}), r(\vect{x'})\} &= \exp\{-\tau/\xi_r\}
\end{align*}
%
and $\tau = |\vect{x} - \vect{x'}|$.

We consider the discretized Gaussian RF $\{r(\vect{x}) \ssep \vect{x} \in \mathrm{L}\}$ on the grid $\mathrm{L} \colon [30 \times 30] \in \mathrm{D}$ with model parameters $\sigma_r^2=2$ and $\xi_r=15$. In figure \ref{fig:}
