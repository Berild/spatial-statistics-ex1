Continuous spatial variable in $\mathbb{R}^1$: 
\begin{align*}
    \{r(x): x \in \text{D} &: [1,50] \subset \mathbb{R}^1\} \\
    E\{r(x)\} &= \mu_r = 0\\
    Var\{r(x)\} & = \sigma_r^2 \\
    Corr\{r(x)\} & = \rho_r(\tau)
\end{align*}

$\tau = |x-x^\prime|/10.$ 
Discretization: $\text{L} \in \{1,2,...,50\}$.
The discretized random field (RF) is 
\begin{equation*}
    \{r(x): x \in \text{L}\}.
\end{equation*}

\paragraph{a)}
 The spatial correlation function $\rho_r(\tau)$ needs to be positive definite because...?

Two possible correlation functions, $\rho_r(\tau)$, the Powered exponential and the Matern. Cruical features for the spatial correlation function...?

Relation variance/correlation with variogram function?

\paragraph{b)}
The discretized prior Gaussian model has pdf
\begin{equation}
    \vect{r} \sim p(\vect{r}) = \phi_n(\vect{r}; \mu_r \vect(i)_n, \sigma_r^2\matr{\Sigma}_r^{\rho}),
\end{equation}
where $n = 50$ is the number of grid points in $\text{L},$ $\vect{i}_n$ is a $n$-vector with $1$s and $\matr{\Sigma}_r^{\rho}$ is the correlation matrix for the grid points, defined from the spatial correlation function.
